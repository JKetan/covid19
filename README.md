Covid19 Detection using LBP and Machine Learning
- Classified chest X-Ray images for pneumonia and COVID-19 using five machine learning models and their ensembles with a high classification accuracy of 89.17%.
- Used a dataset of 305 chest X-Ray images with covid19, pneumonia and healthy lungs.
- Performed feature extraction using Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and obtained feature vectors.
- Experimented with the radius and number of neighbors parameters of the algorithm for parameter tuning.
- Applied several machine learning algorithms and multi-layer perceptrons with different parameters to identify covid19 instances.
- Used accuracy, positive predictive value (ppv), sensitivity, f-measure and matthews correlation coefficient (mcc) for evaluation.
- Published two research papers for the work.
